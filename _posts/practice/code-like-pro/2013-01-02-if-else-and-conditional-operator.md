1. Write a program to check if an entered number is even or odd, without using the % operator.
2. Write a program to find the maximum of three numbers, using conditional operator.
3. Write a program to check if an entered year is Leap Year or not. (**Hint:** A Leap Year is a year containing 366 days)
4. A company hires 4 different types of employess: HR Personnel, Manager, Project Lead or Techie.
