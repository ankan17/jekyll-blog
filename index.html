                        <p class="text-justify"> Since you're here, you realize that a self-obsessed guy is going to talk about himself. Let me do that. My journey started from a small town in Bihar, and hence I had no exposure to programming and computer science whatsoever. But I had an interest, and a computer, and yeah, also a slow internet connection which helped me learn a lot about computers, not programming though. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify"> Then I came to West Bengal for higher studies and I joined a course with computer science as my fifth subject. Frankly, I was scared to see that all my peers had done quite a bit of programming and I was a complete zero. But I had the will to learn and I have learnt a lot over those two years. I joined a Computer Science and Engineering course in National Institute of Technology, Durgapur. Once I was here, I was overwhelmed to see how many people approached me to teach them programming just so they could pass the exams. </p>
                        <p class="text-justify"> All this has led me to start this blog. This blog is for them who think that C is very tough to learn. I started this blog so that I can help beginners to learn C and help those who already know about C to strengthen their grasp and I also learn a lot in the process. I wish everyone will have a good time learning about C here. Cheers. </p>
